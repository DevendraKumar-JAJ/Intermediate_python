# Banking System 🏦

A simple banking system implemented in Python 🐍.

## Features 📝
- Create new bank accounts 📈
- Show account details 📊
- Withdraw amount 💸
- Deposit amount 💸
- Exit the system 👋

## Requirements 📚
- Python 3.x 🐍

## How to Run 🚀
1. Save the code in a file named banking_system.py.
2. Run the file using Python: python banking_system.py.

## Usage 📄
1. When prompted, choose to open a new account by entering y or Y 👍.
2. Enter your name, and the system will generate a random account number and customer ID 🔒.
3. You can then choose to:
    - Show account details 📊
    - Withdraw amount 💸
    - Deposit amount 💸
    - Exit the system 👋

## Code Structure 📁
The code is structured into two main parts:

- The Acc class represents a bank account, with methods for showing account details, withdrawing amount, and depositing amount 📈.
- The main function implements the banking system, allowing users to create new accounts, perform operations, and exit the system 💻.

## Notes 📝
- The system uses a simple list to store account objects 📁.
- The account numbers are generated randomly, but in a real-world system, you would want to use a more robust method to generate unique account numbers 🔒.
- The system does not handle errors robustly, and you may want to add more error checking and handling in a real-world implementation 🚨.
